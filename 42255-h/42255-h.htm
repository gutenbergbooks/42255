<h2><a name="A_LITTLE_FLEET" id="A_LITTLE_FLEET">A LITTLE FLEET</a></h2>


<p>The following account of the Fleet,
and of the various histories of the
voyages of the vessels which compose
it, has been written out by me
at the request of the owners. I
have also made for them the
drawings and the chart which illustrate
the account.</p>

<p>The owners of this small merchant
fleet had nowhere else handy
to float their vessels in than the
small and winding Gara river and
a very small pond; the vessels
when upon the river drove along
with the stream, their sails, when
they had any, only being of use to
get them out of bad places, except
occasionally when the current ran
slowly; then, with a fair wind, the
&ldquo;Pasear&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Monte,&rdquo; at
any rate, would walk along at a
fine pace.</p>

<p>Long, light sticks were carried to
steer the ships round dangerous
corners, and through narrow and
difficult channels like the Two
Snags; and when I say she steered
this way, or her skipper took such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a course, you will understand it is
just put that way because it sounds
better.</p>

<p>The two longest voyages were
those of the &ldquo;Theodore&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Pasear,&rdquo; both of which vessels
travelled about a mile along the
river. The owners think that any
other little boys who live near a
stream sufficiently deep to float
ships drawing so little water might
like to follow their example and
build a fleet, therefore I am to tell
you how each vessel was built, as
well as the story of its voyage.</p>

<p>The chart shows the winding river
down which the clippers voyaged,
and on it are marked the various
snags, rapids, and other dangers.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MONTE" id="THE_MONTE">THE &ldquo;MONTE&rdquo;</a></h2>


<p>The &ldquo;Monte&rdquo; was the first of
our vessels, and was made out of a
flat piece of wood about five inches
long, shaped at one end for the bow.
She had two masts of very thin
wood, and was rigged as a fore
and aft schooner with paper sails,
which had holes in them so as to
fasten them to the masts.</p>

<p>She had a stone underneath her
to keep her upright, and a piece of
string tied round her, amidships,
to keep on the stone. In the picture
the stone is shown through the
water, so that you can see how it
was fastened on, but it did not
really show like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE &ldquo;MONTE&rsquo;S&rdquo; VOYAGE</h3>

<p>She started from No Name Strait
with wind and tide; it was blowing
a gale at the time&mdash;of course you
will understand that it was not
blowing a gale <i>to us</i>, but in proportion
to the size of her, it must
have been a gale to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>She kept her course toward the
land, going by the Round Channel,
as we had not then discovered the
passage through the Two Snags
she then put her helm to port and
bore away for mid-stream to avoid
the nifty Snags that lie at the foot
of the bluff called Pirate&rsquo;s Leap,
called that because a poet who had
been a pirate, I expect, was thinking
about a poem when he ought to
have been shoving the vessel off
the rocks, and so he fell in.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Monte&rdquo; then put her head
south-west by south, half south, a
little southerly, sir, and tried to
make the current called the Bully
Bowline, but she kept too far to the
west&rsquo;ard, and so she got caught by
the other current, the wrong one,
called the Blackwall Hitch. The
&ldquo;Monte&rsquo;s&rdquo; skipper got excited then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and tried to cross the middle of the
river, but she dashed round in the
current under the cliffs, and was
only saved by very good steering
from running straight into the very
dangerous snags called the Bad
Snags.</p>

<p>However, she weathered them
and dashed on over the Marbley
Shallows; we called them that
because the stones under the water
used to roll along like a lot of little
marbles. She kept a fine course
from that on, and went at a great
pace, about fifteen knots; once she
stuck her nose in the bank, but the
sails swung her round, so on she
went and ran beautifully into Safety
Cove. But, like a silly, her skipper
came out of it again before we could
tell him not to, and hit against, oh!
such a nasty rock; it heaved her on
her beamends, and then she turned
very slowly round until her masts
and sails were underneath, and her
stone keel on top. And that was
the end of her.</p>

<p>This was what the Pirate Poet
made about her:</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOBY_DICK" id="THE_MOBY_DICK">THE &ldquo;MOBY DICK&rdquo;</a></h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She sailed down Gara Valley,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She startled all the cows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With touchwood in her galley,<br /></span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30px;">
<a href="images/i06large.jpg"><img src="images/i06.jpg" width="30" height="31" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo; was supposed
to be a Mississippi River steamboat;
she was built out of a flat piece of
board almost fourteen inches long
and six inches broad; on top of that
she had a cardboard box with cabin
windows drawn on it, and she had
cardboard paddle-boxes with her
name painted on them with ink;
she also had an eagle painted on
her deck-house. Inside her deck-house
there was a cocoa tin with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
cardboard funnel coming out of the
top of it. The tin was there so
that we could make a fire in it of
paper and touchwood. At first,
when we made our fire, it would
not burn because there was no
draught, so we made a large hole
in front of the deck-house and
another one abaft, also holes in the
side of the cocoa tin; that made a
draught, and then you should have
seen the smoke coming out of her
funnel!</p>


<h3>THE FIRST VOYAGE OF THE
&ldquo;MOBY DICK&rdquo;</h3>

<p>She started from No Name Straits,
but she had to put back again
because her fire was not burning,
so we stirred it up a bit and put in
some more dry touchwood, then it
smoked fine, and we let her go.</p>

<p>She was going the Round Channel
when her Mate sung out to the
Captain:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go through the Two
Snags!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never do it!&rdquo; shouted the
Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try her!&rdquo; yelled the Mate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; roared the Captain,
and the Mate shoved the helm hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
up, and she slid through without
touching anywhere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i07large.jpg"><img src="images/i07.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>And so the &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo; was the
first to use the Two Snags Passage.</i>
Since then all our vessels have
used it.</p>

<p>After she had passed through she
bore away towards the easterly
shore, and went easily along with
the Bully Bowline current; but as
she was not smoking properly, her
Captain gave orders to beach her
on Treasure Beach (we called it
that name because it looked just
the sort of beach pirates would
choose to bury treasure in). When
she came ashore we stirred up her
furnace until it burnt magnificently,
then we shoved her off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
again, and she looked really great
as her smoke and herself were both
reflected in the water as clear as
anything. She then continued her
voyage over the Marbley Shallows
on to Safety Cove.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo; did so well
that run that we thought we would
send her down the river again at
once, and we <i>did</i> send her down,
and no mistake, because we put an
anchor on her stern, with lots of
cable, and just when she was going
through No Name Straits she let
go her anchor, because we wanted
to see how she would look when it
brought her up all standing.</p>

<p>Well, she dragged her anchor for
a few yards until it caught in a
weed, and what did she do but get
pulled right down to the bottom of
the river, the stream was too strong
for her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She came to flying anchor<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the twilight time of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the strain on the cable sank her,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And her crew, oh, where were they?<br /></span>
<hr class="chap" />

</div>



<h2><a name="THE_THEODORE" id="THE_THEODORE">THE &ldquo;THEODORE&rdquo;</a></h2>


<p>There was nothing very grand
about the appearance of the
&ldquo;Theodore&rdquo;; we were in a great
hurry to go out, so could only build
her very badly, but in spite of that
she was a jolly good clipper.</p>

<p>She was built out of a long cardboard
box, and had the lines of her
ports painted on with ink, and the
portholes were cut out. She did
not have any masts, we did not
have time to make any for her.</p>


<h3>THE VERY LONG VOYAGE OF
THE &ldquo;THEODORE.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;Theodore&rdquo; was launched
to the north of the Two Snags, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
she caught fire suddenly&mdash;really, we
set fire to a lot of touchwood and
stuff inside her because we wanted
to see what a ship on fire would
look like on the river.</p>

<p>And she looked splendid with the
crimson flames coming out of her
ports, and the reflection on the still
piece of water just under the cliffs
was beautiful.</p>

<p>The fire burnt away like mad,
and did not go out till she got as
far as Safety Cove. But the fire
had not done the old &ldquo;Theodore&rdquo;
a bit of harm; the water kept the
fire from burning through her,
except for one big hole the fire had
burnt through just above the water
line.</p>

<p>The skipper set all hands to work
to rig up a tarpaulin to keep the
water out; we really stuffed a big
dock leaf in, and the &ldquo;Theodore&rdquo;
continued her voyage right through
a terribly dangerous passage at the
western end of the Twisty Straits,
opposite the Desolate Dead Man&rsquo;s
Teeth, and she passed The Narrows,
the most dangerous place on the
whole river, where there is only just
room for one vessel to pass through
at a time.</p>

<p>She continued round the next
bend in great style, passing under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the Buccaneers&rsquo; Gallows, another
most desperate place, and came
out in the beautiful clear water,
where she went along finely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i09large.jpg"><img src="images/i09.jpg" width="400" height="298" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Then we had to go home, and the
last we saw of her she was going
round a big bend as fast as anything,
and the man on the look-out
was singing out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;All clear ahead!&rdquo; and the skipper
was singing out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her as she goes!&rdquo; and the
man at the wheel was singing out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir! as she goes it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went down the next day, but
saw nothing of her, though we
went ever so far along the river.</p>

<p>She may now be on the high seas,
with a skipper shouting all the time,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her as she goes, and for
the Spanish Main.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And let no landsman doubt it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She was a gallant ship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her Cap. (brave man) throughout it<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kept a stiff upper lip.<br /></span>
</div></div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="THE_PASEAR" id="THE_PASEAR">THE &ldquo;PASEAR&rdquo;</a></h2>


<p>The &ldquo;Pasear&rdquo; was a top-sail
schooner, and could not she just
travel when the wind was in the
proper quarter! She was built out
of a bright green cardboard tie box,
with a lid, and stones inside to
ballast her.</p>

<p>On her fine, long voyage she
passed all the dangers of the narrow
reaches of the river, and sailed out
into the deep, clear channel before
the wind; and she went so far and
so fast that it took us all our time
to keep up with her, so we could
not think of names for all the headlands
she passed&mdash;she went nearly
a mile.</p>

<p>Then &ldquo;it was time for us to leave
her,&rdquo; so we left her all snug and
comfortable in a little cove called
Huckleberry Cove, after Finn.</p>

<p>We could not get down to the
river again for two days, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
we did we could not find her for a
long time, but at last we did find
her&mdash;under water&mdash;she had gone
down in twenty fathoms, we could
see her quite clearly resting on
the sandy bottom; she must have
sprung a leak, and her captain had
not the sense to beach her, as he
should have done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i10large.jpg"><img src="images/i10.jpg" width="400" height="295" alt="" /></a>
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="THE_NEW" id="THE_NEW">THE &ldquo;NEW
CORINTHIAN&rdquo;</a></h2>


<p>She was the finest vessel we had
in the fleet.</p>

<p>She was built out of a toy lifeboat,
with a lead keel fastened on,
and she had paper sails and a
rudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i11large.jpg"><img src="images/i11.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The &ldquo;New Corinthian&rdquo; sailed in
the nicest way, but we were too
proud of her, after we had rigged
her, to let her go down the big river,
so we sailed her on a small pond
called Mystery Bay; we called it
that name because it looked so
terribly deep, but was really only
about three feet deep.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;New Corinthian&rdquo; did not
have any adventurous voyages, but
she had as good a time as she could
have, sailing round and round
Mystery Bay.</p>

<p>But it must have been pretty
exciting on her when the tadpoles
tried to board her.</p>

<p>But what we liked best was
seeing the vessels of our fleet tearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and gliding and shooting down
the flood and through the currents
of the Gara river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i12large.jpg"><img src="images/i12.jpg" width="400" height="294" alt="" /></a>
</div>


<h3>NOTICE TO MARINERS.</h3>

<p>Since the above was written, the
owners have put a buoy in mid-stream,
between the Blackwall
Hitch and Bully Bowline currents,
and mariners will keep a south-easterly
course, leaving the buoy
nine fathoms and a-half on the
starboard.</p>

<h2>JAMES FLAUNTY:</h2>

<p class="center large"><b>OR, THE TERROR OF THE WESTERN SEAS.</b></p>

<p class="center"><b>1s. net; or, Coloured by the Author, 5s. net.</b></p>


<p>&ldquo;A &lsquo;<span class="smcap">memory</span>&rsquo; of R. L. Stevenson comes seldom amiss, and now especially, when
the romancer&rsquo;s name and fame are as a shuttlecock between wholly adoring and
still discriminating friends, may be considered apt and seasonable. So it won&rsquo;t
hurt to read this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There stands, I fancy, to this day (but now how fallen!) a certain stationer&rsquo;s
shop at a corner of the wide thoroughfare that joins the city of my childhood with
the sea. When upon any Saturday we made a party to behold the ships, we
passed that corner; and since in those days I loved a ship as a man loves
Burgundy or daybreak, this of itself had been enough to hallow it. But there
was more than that. In that window, all the year round, there stood displayed a
theatre in working order, with a &lsquo;forest set,&rsquo; &lsquo;a combat,&rsquo; and a few &lsquo;robbers
carousing&rsquo; in the slides; and below and about&mdash;dearer tenfold to me!&mdash;the plays
themselves, those budgets of romance, lay tumbled, one upon another.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>A Penny
Plain and Twopence Coloured.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, palpably, was a hint for somebody, who has turned out to be Mr. Jack
B. Yeats. The first of his &lsquo;plays in the old manner&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;<i>James Flaunty; or, The
Terror of the Western Seas</i>&rsquo;&mdash;lies before me, and it is a study in grotesque. The
most notable point in this production is the fact that the interest thereof attaches
not only to the dialogue&mdash;you will, however, relish that&mdash;but to the setting, the
close reproduction of old-world lettering and art, which is a vast deal more
than an ordinary publisher&rsquo;s advertisement, and cunning enough to deceive the
very elect. The ferocious woodcuts, the jaunty humour of the speeches, the fore-and-aft
and down-the-hatchway plot, the bizarre characters, harmonize perfectly,
and well they may; for Mr. Yeats, all by himself, has invented those same
characters, contrived the plot, fashioned the speeches, and designed the
illustrations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Debauched by sixpenny and even threepenny editions, some may rail at this
as a dear shilling&rsquo;s worth. (For superior copies the charge is a crown.) For all
such niggards this lean but precious pamphlet&mdash;it is no more&mdash;will be caviare.
But drat economy, say I, when a paltry subscription will land you straight into
the arms of a real toy pirate. Never again will you have so good a chance of
seeing one, of hanging on his talk, of sympathising with his peril. Never, I
mean, apart from the present showmen, who, however, promise yet better things.
Stevenson, you mark, had two sources of enjoyment&mdash;play and puppet-show&mdash;and
Mr. Mathews announces his intention of producing the plays, with scenes and
characters, on sheets, to be cut out and played on miniature stages. What <i>will</i>
the next generation be like? Certes, &rsquo;tis a bold experiment, and, to say the worst,
a queer revival.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Speaker, 1/2/02.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. J. S.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">At</span> a time when the palmy days of the drama are a melancholy remembrance, we
welcome the publication of <i>James Flaunty; or, The Terror of the Western Seas</i>, by
Jack B. Yeats (Elkin Mathews), which, in its awakening of romance, may be
dimly associated with the Celtic revival. The spirit of the publication may be
indicated by a quotation on the cover from Stevenson&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Penny Plain and
Twopence Coloured.&rsquo; It is announced that copies of the play coloured by the
author may be had for five shillings, but it is difficult to believe that colour can
add materially to the excellence of these designs. Still, a judicious use of
crimson lake (&lsquo;Hark to the sound of it, reader,&rsquo; as Stevenson says) might add
something to the glories of Captain Gig and the rest. We may particularly commend
the reticence of effect in the pictures, which aim at no vulgarity of facetiousness,
and there is an exquisite moderation in the dialogue. &lsquo;It is intended
later to produce the plays with scenes and characters on sheets, to be cut out and
placed on miniature stages.&rsquo; We should like to be there to see.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian, 10/12/01.</i></p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jack B. Yeats&rsquo;s latest play for the miniature stage, <i>The Scourge of the Gulph</i>
(Elkin Mathews, pp. 18, 1s. net), has the same exalted qualities that endeared
&lsquo;James Flaunty&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Treasure of the Garden&rsquo; to the judicious. Blood
runs gaily through the lee scuppers, in accordance with the best precedents; but
plenty more of it is left to keep up the native hue of resolution in the cheeks of
the survivors. If Mr. Andrew Lang ever finds the &lsquo;Odyssey&rsquo; losing its power
to affect the mind like ocean thundering on a Western beach, he should try &lsquo;The
Scourge of the Gulph.&rsquo; There is a delicious drawing by Mr. Jack Yeats on the
back of the cover.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian, 12/1/04.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> sensations of wonder and respect produced by Mr. Jack B. Yeats&rsquo;s play (for
a miniature theatre), &lsquo;James Flaunty; or, The Terror of the Western Seas,&rsquo; are
deepened by the appearance of <i>The Treasure of the Garden</i> (Elkin Mathews,
5s. net). Here we have no mere jejune text, but also the characters and the
scenery painted unstintingly by the author, and all ready to be gummed on cardboard
and strut and fret their five minutes on the toy stage. As Stevenson, were
he now living, would probably cut his work in order to produce this drama if it
reached him in working hours, the rest of us need take no shame to ourselves for
the same inclination. For about ten shillings&mdash;a stage costs five shillings&mdash;the
least among us may now explore the sensations of theatrical management&mdash;a
happiness for which far higher prices have been paid by many famous lessees of
Covent Garden and Drury Lane.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian, 2/3/03.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;So many in these days are for reviving the romantic drama, for bringing to life&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
The mellow glory of the Attic stage,<br />
</p>

<p>and for restoring the arts of acting and of speaking verse, that we have come to
regard the exposition of a new theory without emotion; the advent of a new play
without excitement. Our romantic dramatists take themselves too seriously, and
aim at expressing rather the sorrows than the joys of life. Since the world has
heard the beauty of the muted string it has forgotten that life ever went merrily
to a pipe, or to the Arcadian, but penny, whistle. It has forgotten the song, and
the old tune, and the old story. It has forgotten that the drama ever shook men&rsquo;s
hearts, and has come to prefer that it should help to digest men&rsquo;s dinners. We
want&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
The old laughter that had April in it.<br />
</p>

<p>Now perhaps the chief reason for the dulness of modern plays is the somewhat
exclusive attitude of the playwright. His appeal is no longer to the world. His
appeal is to an audience. No breadth of range, no scope, is allowed to him. He
has lost touch with the external forces of daily life. An introspective study, an
allegory of the state of his own mind, is the most we can look for from him.</p>

<p>But in Mr. Jack B. Yeats we recognise the makings of a dramatist of an older
order; a writer of plays that are written in the intimate speech of the folk-ballad.
While his contemporaries argue, wrangle and disagree as to what is music, and
what is the best music, and what music saves a man&rsquo;s soul, he, like the hero Finn,
is content with the best of all music&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
The music of the thing that happens.<br />
</p>

<p>His play of &lsquo;<i>The Treasure of the Garden</i>&rsquo; carries on a tradition that shook the stage
before playwrights became self-conscious and before poets aimed to please the
high foreheads in the stalls. There is no mental dyspepsia in his characters.
They present no problem. Their aim is to be real. To be glad and sorry for a
little while on a miniature stage measuring a foot across.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Academy, 14/3/03.</i></p></blockquote>
